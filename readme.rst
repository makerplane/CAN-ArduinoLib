*************************************
MakerPlane Arduino CAN Library
*************************************

This is a CAN Library for interfacing the Arduino to an MCP2515 CAN Controller.

It was specifically written for the MakerPlane Avionics family of devices.  It
is the base CAN library used for the CAN-FIX protocol libraries.  CAN-FIX is
the primary means of communication between MakerPlane avionics devices.

This library is not meant to be a general solution.  Not all the features of the
MCP2515 are available in this libary.  Only the features that are needed for
the implementation of CAN-FIX are abstracted.
